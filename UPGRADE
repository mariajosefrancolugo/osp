These instructions are primarily for installs configured using the
setup.sh script. If you have installed OSP in a non-standard way, you
will need to glean from this document what you can and apply it to your
own environment.

    1. Ensure that the WORKON_HOME environment variable is set and the
       virtualenvwrapper.sh file is sourced in your bash config. Also
       make sure that you have the correct paths on your PYTHONPATH.

       In ~/.bashrc, add the following lines and save:

       export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/opt/wsgi:/opt/django
       export WORKON_HOME=/opt/virtualenv
       source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
       
       Then, source your .bashrc file:
       
       $ source ~/.bashrc

    2. Ensure that South is installed in your virtualenv's site-packages
   
       $ workon osp
       $ easy_install South

    3. Download the upgrade script and make it executable

       $ cd ~
       $ wget http://osp.googlecode.com/hg/scripts/upgrade.py
       $ chmod +x upgrade.py

    4. Ensure that there is not a directory named "osp" at the same
       level as the upgrade script

       $ mv osp osp.bak

    5. Run the upgrade script and answer the questions as prompted

       $ ./upgrade.py

    6. Restart Apache

       $ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
