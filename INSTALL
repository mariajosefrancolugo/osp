Installing OSP can be as simple as running the following command from a
terminal session in the root directory of the application:

    sudo python setup.py install

However, we recommend that you install OSP within a Python virtualenv
in order to keep your environment entirely self-contained. More
information on how to do this can be found in
docs/installing_and_configuring_virtualenv.rst or in the Google Code
wiki documentation.
